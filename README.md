# Password Checker

## Overview

Password Checker is a web-based application designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords, generate secure passwords, and understand how to improve their password security. It provides real-time feedback on password strength, entropy, and estimated cracking time, ensuring users can make informed decisions about their online security.

## Features

- **Password Strength Validation**: Checks passwords against key criteria such as length, character diversity, and the inclusion of special characters.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the randomness of a password in bits, providing a clear indication of its strength.
- **Cracking Time Estimation**: Estimates how long it would take to brute-force the password using modern computing power.
- **Banned Password Detection**: Warns users if their password is commonly used or insecure.
- **Password Generator**: Creates strong, random passwords that meet best practices for security.
- **Hash Generation**: Displays SHA-256 and MD5 hashes of the password for additional insights.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Offers actionable tips to enhance password strength.
- **Matrix Animation**: A visually appealing background inspired by the "Matrix" movie.

## Why Use Password Checker?

1. **Enhanced Security**: Weak passwords are a leading cause of data breaches. Password Checker helps users create and evaluate strong passwords to protect their accounts.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is intuitive and easy to use, with real-time feedback and clear visual indicators.
3. **Educational Value**: Learn about password entropy, cracking time, and best practices for password creation.
4. **Customizable**: Developers can extend or modify the tool to suit specific needs, thanks to its modular and well-documented codebase.
5. **Open Source**: The project is open source, allowing anyone to contribute, improve, or adapt it for their purposes.

## How to Use

# Password Checker

## Description

Password Checker is a web application designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords and improve their online security. It provides real-time feedback on password strength, entropy, and estimated cracking time. Additionally, it includes features like password generation, clipboard support, and detection of common or insecure passwords. This tool is ideal for anyone looking to enhance their password security.

## Features

- **Password Strength Meter**: Visual representation of password strength based on entropy.
- **Hashing Algorithms**: Displays SHA-256 and MD5 hashes of the entered password.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the randomness of a password in bits.
- **Estimated Cracking Time**: Provides an estimate of how long it would take to brute-force the password.
- **Password Generator**: Generates strong, random passwords.
- **Clipboard Support**: Easily copy hashes or generated passwords to the clipboard.
- **Common Password Detection**: Warns users if their password is commonly used or insecure.
- **Security Tips**: Offers actionable suggestions to improve password strength.
- **Matrix Animation**: A visually appealing background inspired by the "Matrix" movie.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Password_checker.git
   cd Password_checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   - Ensure you have a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to run the app.
   - No additional dependencies are required for this project.

3. Open the application:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to launch the app.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Password**: Type a password into the input field to analyze its strength.
2. **Generate a Password**: Click the "Generate Strong Password" button to create a secure password.
3. **View Hashes**: See the SHA-256 and MD5 hashes of the entered password.
4. **Analyze Strength**: Review the entropy, cracking time, and feedback on password requirements.
5. **Copy to Clipboard**: Use the "Copy" buttons to copy hashes or generated passwords.
6. **Improve Security**: Follow the improvement suggestions to create a stronger password.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies for the frontend.
- **CryptoJS**: Library for generating MD5 hashes.
- **Canvas API**: Used for the dynamic "Matrix" animation background.

## Security Considerations

- **Improved Password Security**: The app educates users on creating strong passwords and avoiding common pitfalls.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All password analysis is done locally in the browser, ensuring no data is sent to external servers.
- **Limitations**: The app does not store or transmit passwords but relies on user input, so it cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Future Improvements

- **Integration with Password Managers**: Allow users to save and manage passwords securely.
- **Customizable Password Policies**: Enable users to define specific password requirements.
- **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide more detailed insights into password security.
